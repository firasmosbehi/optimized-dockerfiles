# 🚀 Optimized Dockerfiles Collection

This repository contains a curated set of **production-ready**, **DevOps-focused**, and **highly optimized Dockerfiles** for different kinds of applications and stacks.  
The purpose is to provide learning resources and ready-to-use examples that demonstrate **best practices for containerization**, **image optimization**, and **production deployment**.

## 🎯 Repository Goals

- Provide **real-world Dockerfile examples** for multiple technologies.
- Demonstrate **multi-stage builds**, **image minimization**, and **secure production setups**.
- Compare **optimized** vs **non-optimized** Dockerfiles.
- Offer **DevOps patterns** for CI/CD, caching, static serving, and deployment.
- Serve as a reference for building your own production-grade Docker images.

## 🐳 Docker Philosophy Used in This Repo

This repository follows production-grade principles:

### ✔ Multi-Stage Builds  
Reduce final image size by separating build and runtime stages.

### ✔ Minimal Base Images  
Using `alpine`, `scratch`, or distroless where applicable.

### ✔ Static Asset Serving  
Frontend projects use **Nginx** instead of `vite preview`.

### ✔ Security Hardening  
- Non-root users where possible  
- Read-only filesystem  
- Minimal OS footprint  

### ✔ CI/CD Friendly  
All examples are built to:

- Be cache efficient  
- Work well with GitHub Actions  
- Push easily to Docker Hub

## 🔄 CI/CD Integration

Soon you'll find:

- GitHub Actions templates for:
  - Building Docker images  
  - Tagging releases  
  - Pushing to Docker Hub  
  - Multi-platform builds (`amd64`, `arm64`)
